- My ideas of robots haven't really changed... <br> I think I have always been facinated by them <br>but,  also really scared of them at the same time. <br>
- I really liked how I was able to understand <br>
 circuits and how everything worked even if it <br>
 was far away from eachother.

- My partner and I worked on our lightshow by <br>
first psuedo coding everything first. We then <br>
looked at examples and tried applying it to our <br>
scenario, fixing it until it finally worked. <br>
- Some of the basic pieces of every Arduino <br>
are how you have to include the access to the <br>
servo library, you have to have a void setup, <br>
and you have to have a void loop.

- Something I learned about circuits<br>
was that wires have to be on a certain<br>
part of the board to send electricity to <br>
the part you want to work. <br>
- My favorite part of my robot dance party was how <br>
my partner and I made it dance to the harry Potter <br>
theme song.
