 circuits and how everything worked even if it <br>
 was far away from eachother.

- My partner and I worked on our lightshow by <br>
first psuedo coding everything first. We then <br>
looked at examples and tried applying it to our <br>
scenario, fixing it until it finally worked. <br>

are how you have to include the access to the <br>
servo library, you have to have a void setup, <br>
and you have to have a void loop.

was that wires have to be on a certain<br>

my partner and I made it dance to the harry Potter <br>

- A MVC is a pattern for relating user inter face to data models <br>
- The difference between a framework anf a library is, the library is where it stores <br>
	information to help you, while the framework is what you actually create. <br>
- You might decide to use a framework insead of creating an App <br> 
	because maybe you don't have enough time and you don't want <br>
to do so much work. It just makes you life a whole lot easier.
